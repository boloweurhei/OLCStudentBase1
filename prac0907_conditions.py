# Exercise 2: Simple if Statement
# Use an if statement to check if a number is positive.
# Example input: number = 5

#if num > 0:
#    print("the number is positive.")

# Exercise 3: if-else Statement
# Use an if-else statement to check if a number is positive or negative.
# Example input: number = -3
# Expected output: 'The number is negative.'
'''
# Write your code here
#num = int(input("What is the number? "))
#if num < 0:

# Example input: a = 10, b = 10
# Expected output: 'a and b are equal.'
'''
# Write your code here
#a = int(input("What is the first number? "))

'''
# Exercise 6: Check Even or Odd

# hint: use the mod %, any number divisible by 2 is even
'''
# Write your code here
#num = int(input("What is the number? "))
#if num % 2 == 0:
#    print("The number is even.")
